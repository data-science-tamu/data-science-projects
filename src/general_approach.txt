In equation 12 add w_u L_u (equation 10)
u_i is the data (provided displacements)
u_pred DNN fitting coordinates to the above (result)

use displacement model to fit coordinates to actual displacement
Their is a worry about over-fitting

Options
1. Run simultaneous
2. Fit u(x,y) first
3. Fit u(x,y) partial
